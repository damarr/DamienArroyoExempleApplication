# DamienArroyoExempleApplication
 
This web application was developped by Damien Arroyo in the context of a technical display of his skills

This app was developped with Kotlin for the backend and VueJs with Typescript for the frontend

## Installation

### Backend

Make sure you have Java JDK 21 installed. You can test your install with 

```bash
java -version
```

If you do not have Java JDK 21 installed, install it [here](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/)

Your computer might need a restart for peak operation.

Navigate to the directory of the backend and into the target folder (DamienArroyoExempleApplication -> backend -> DamienArroyoExempleBackend -> target)

Run this command to start the backend. It might take a few seconds to a couple minutes to start up (Testing on different machines yeilded different results)

```bash
java -jar DamienArroyoBackend.jar
```

### Frontend

Install the latest version of [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)

Navigate to the directory of the frontend (DamienArroyoExempleApplication -> frontend -> damienarroyoexemple) and use NPM to install the frontend packages 

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
npm i
```

You can now run the frontend with this command

```bash
npm run dev
```
